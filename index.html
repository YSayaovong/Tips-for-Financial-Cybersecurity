    <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Use Strong Passwords</h2>
    <p>Using complex passwords that combine uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols is critical to protecting your financial accounts from unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
    <p>Two-factor authentication adds an additional layer of security by requiring not only a password but also a second form of identification, like a mobile code.</p>

    <h2>3. Monitor Account Activity Regularly</h2>
    <p>Check your account statements frequently for any unauthorized transactions. Early detection of suspicious activity can prevent larger issues.</p>

    <h2>4. Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Financial Transactions</h2>
    <p>Public Wi-Fi networks are not secure, making it easier for attackers to intercept your data. Always use a secure network when managing financial accounts.</p>

    <h2>5. Be Wary of Phishing Scams</h2>
    <p>Do not click on links in unsolicited emails or texts. Phishing attacks often trick users into giving up sensitive information like login credentials or financial data.</p>

    <h2>6. Keep Your Software and Systems Updated</h2>
    <p>Ensure that your operating system, apps, and antivirus software are regularly updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h2>7. Use Secure Connections (HTTPS)</h2>
    <p>When conducting online transactions, make sure the website uses HTTPS, indicated by a padlock icon in the browser's address bar, to ensure your connection is secure.</p>

    <h2>8. Review Privacy Settings</h2>
    <p>Adjust the privacy settings on your financial accounts and apps to limit data sharing, ensuring only essential information is visible or shared.</p>
